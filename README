Installation:
----------
Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Support:
----------
Please read the documentation included in the srvx distribution before
you ask us for support. The answers to many common questions related
to installation are in the FAQ file. Other important documentation
files have names in all upper case.  It saves both your time and our
time, so please read the documentation.

If you change the credits in your version of the code so as to obscure
the original authorship of the program, we will not support you.  If
you want to use our code -- especially if you want us to answer your
questions about it -- do the decent thing and preserve the credits
that are in the code we distribute.

How HelpServ Works
------------------

HelpServ is a bot designed to help with queues of questions (or
support requests).  It's designed to work well in multiple channels
at once.

There is a one-to-one mapping between help bots and channels they act
in; this is to allow privmsgs to work without having users specify a
channel (which is much easier to use).  For example, HelpServ might be
in #support, and Interview could be in #counterstrike; both would be
bots of this kind, but they would have totally separate user lists and
data sets.

Each channel/help bot has a set of "helper" users, defined by the
channel admin(s).  In the rest of this document, I will use "helper"
to indicate someone on the helper list for the channel, and "user" to
indicate all other users.  There are also "manager" users and one
"owner" for the bot.

There are two primary modes: "command mode" and "help mode."  Helpers
default to command mode, and other users default to help mode.
Command mode uses a command parser similar to the standard services.
Help mode queues each user's messages into a virtual folder for later
perusal by a helper.  A helper who is actively using "help mode" may
issue "command mode" lines by prefixing them with a "command word" for
the channel.

In Help Mode
------------

When a normal user joins the channel, a customizable greeting is sent.
This usually tells the user to privmsg the bot for help (or to queue a
question).  It is recommended that this include a URL to a FAQ.  The
bot then shuts up until the user msgs them again.

When a user msgs the bot for the first time after they join, it opens
a virtual folder for them.  The time of this request is filed, and
they are added to a queue.  It also sends another customizable
message.  The virtual folder is kept active until a helper closes it
or the user is "lost"; when the virtual folder is closed, it is
written out to a file (with statistics on when it was opened, closed,
if (and when) it was picked up by a helper, etc).

A user is "lost" when:
 - For QUIT-based requests (or queues), the user disconnects from IRC.
 - For PART-based requests, the user parts the channel.
 - For handle-based requests, the handle is unregistered.
The "default" mode for queues is close-based -- which behaves as
handle-based if the user is authed and quit-based otherwise.

Helpers may also annotate an existing request, using the NOTE command.

In Command Mode
---------------

The following commands are defined:

LIST - show the currently open requests (unassigned first, then
  assigned)

NEXT - acts as PICKUP for the next unassigned request

PICKUP <reqno> - assign request number to self

REASSIGN <reqno> <helpernick|*handle> - reassign request to another
  (online) helper

CLOSE <reqno> <comment> - close request, with comment
CLOSELAST <comment>     - close last PICKUP'ed or HANDOFF'ed request

NOTE [<reqno>] <comment> - add a note to a request (if not a number, use last assigned)

TOGMODE - switch between command mode and help mode

IGNORE <handle>         - Ignore the specified handle (or hostmask)
IGNORE <nick!user@host> - in the future.  Does not close current requests.

ADDMANAGER <nick|*handle> - add or remove a manager or helper
DELMANAGER <nick|*handle>   (managers may add and remove users
ADDHELPER <nick|*handle>    and see statistics for anyone)
DELHELPER <nick|*handle>

PAGE [<explanation>] - send a page, if enabled

SET [<option> <value>] - set an option:
  - GREETING - message sent when user joins channel
  - OPENREQ - message sent when user opens a request
  - CLOSEREQ - message sent to requester when a request is closed
  - CMDWORD - "command mode" escape word (for helpers in help mode)
  - PAGEDEST - target for pages
  - PAGEMSG - default page text (if no explanation when PAGE invoked)
  - IDLETIME - how long (with users, not helpers in the channel) before
               bot complains to PAGEDEST
  - WHINETIME - how long before an unhandled request will make the bot
                complain to PAGEDEST
  - WHINEINTERVAL - how frequently the bot will complain about unhandled
                    requests, or users in channel without heleprs there
  - REASSIGN - privileges to use REASSIGN (helper, manager, owner)

STATS [<nick|*handle>] - show statistics for nick/handle (must be self,
                         or self must be a manager; defaults to self)

STATSREPORT - show overall statistics (such as?)

Statistics
----------

For any helper (includes managers), the following statistics are kept:

- Time in channel (total, this week, this month)
- Requests "picked up"
- Requests closed
- Requests handed off
- Handoffs received

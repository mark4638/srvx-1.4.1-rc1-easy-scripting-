srvx Frequently Asked Questions
-------------------------------

This FAQ assumes that your services are named NickServ, ChanServ and
OpServ respectively.

Q1) How do I set up srvx?
A1) Read the README and INSTALL files, especially INSTALL.  If you are
upgrading from srvx-1.2, read UPGRADE.

Q2) How do I set up my IRC server so srvx talks to it?
A2) That depends on which IRC server you use.  Check its
documentation.  #srvx WILL NOT SUPPORT YOUR IRCD QUESTIONS.

Q3) I get "You must first authenticate with NickServ", help!
A3) To register an account, /msg NickServ@services.example.com
register YourName Password.  You must be a global IRC operator to
register the first account; srvx gives the first account "root" level
(1000) access.  To log in afterwards, use the "auth" command instead
of "register".

Q4) I do not like having to type "/msg NickServ@services.example.com"
for all of my commands.  How can I change that?
A4) If you want to disable that for the auth command, use "/msg OpServ
modcmd NickServ.auth flags -qualified".  However, that is a BAD idea:
if you have an auto-perform to log in, and you connect to some other
IRC network, you will send your password to whoever or whatever is
named NickServ on that network.

Q5) When I try to register a channel with ChanServ, it tells me I have
to have "security override" on.  Why?
A5-1) srvx's default configuration is to only allow network staff to
register channels.  For IRC operators and network helpers (users with
account flag +H), security override can be enabled by sending "/msg
ChanServ god on".  For support helpers (users with account flag +h),
security override is enabled when the user is in the configured
support channel.
A5-2) If you want to allow anyone to register channels, use "/msg
OpServ modcmd ChanServ.register flags -helping".

Q6) How do I enable HelpServ?
A6) When you run the "configure" script, you must enable the helpserv
module; for example, "./configure --enable-modules=helpserv".  After
you compile and start srvx with that option, "/msg OpServ bind OpServ
helpserv *helpserv.helpserv".  After that, you can use "/msg OpServ
helpserv help" and "/msg OpServ helpserv register"; the "helpserv"
command acts as a gateway into the HelpServ system.

Q7) How do I enable MemoServ?
A7) When you run the "configure" script, you must enable the MemoServ
module; for example, "./configure --enable-modules=memoserv".  Then
see the comment near the start of src/mod-memoserv.c for configuration
options.

Q8) How do I enable both HelpServ and MemoServ?
A8) In addition to the post-install configuration steps above, you
must mention both when you run the configure script.  For example, run
it using "./configure --enable-modules=memoserv,helpserv".  (You may
add the snoop and/or sockcheck modules as well; separate the module
names with commas.)

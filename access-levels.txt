There are different types of access within srvx.  This document
attempts to list the privileges and restrictions for each (in the
default configuration -- OpServ and ChanServ may be changed at
runtime, and the defaults can be changed in the source).

The basic classes of users are these:
  Unauthenticated user
  Unauthenticated oper
  Authenticated user
  Authenticated support helper
  Authenticated network helper
  Authenticated oper

"Staff" is used to refer to the set of opers (either authenticated or
not) plus authenticated support or networkhelpers.  A staff member
also has an "OpServ access level."  If they are authenticated, it is
the access level of their handle.  If they are not authenticated, it
is zero.

For ChanServ operations on a channel, there is also a "channel access
level."  For peons, this is 100; for ops, 200; for masters, 300; for
co-owners, 400; for owners, 500; and for staff members with security
override on, 600 (if they have a non-override account with sufficient
access, that is used instead).

Authenticated opers and network helpers may use the !god mode in
ChanServ to toggle security override on and off.  Support helpers have
security override on if (and only if) they are in a designated
"support channel."  On GameSurge, this is #support.
